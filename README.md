## Setup

```sh
make setup
```

## How to play?

We have several games. Each one uses the same rules. You are asked three questions, to win you need to answer correctly three times in a row. If you fail the game is over.

To play the games use the following commands:

```sh
brain-even # To play parity check game
brain-calc # To play calculator game
brain-gcd # To play guess-common-divisor game
brain-progression # To play the game of arithmetic progression
brain-prime # To play prime-or-not game
```

Here some examples of how to play the games
